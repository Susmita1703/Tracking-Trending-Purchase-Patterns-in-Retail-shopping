# Tracking-Trending-Purchase-Patterns-in-Retail-shopping
Discover retail trends and purchasing patterns. Analyze consumer behavior for actionable insights.
**Information about dataset**
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to gain insights into customer preferences, seasonal trends, and purchasing behavior. The dataset provides comprehensive details about sales transactions, including information on customers' demographics, purchase amounts, payment methods, and frequency of purchases.

**Objectives**
1. Assess customer sentiment towards product categories.
2. Identify categories with high positive sentiment
3. Identify popular purchasing seasons.
4. Analyze seasonal purchasing patterns.
5. Compare average purchase amounts between genders
6. Determine if preferences influence spending

   **Methodology**
   The analysis will involve descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization techniques. We will use Python programming language along with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

   **Expected outcomes**
   Through this project, we aim to uncover actionable insights that can help retailers optimize their sales strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business performance.

**conclusions**
1 . Among the purchasing customers, approximately 68% are male, with females comprising the remaining 32%. On average, females spend slightly more at 5019.2 compared to males, who spend an average of 4959.8.
2 . Customers tend to purchase the most during Spring and Fall.
3 . Payment method and shipping type show no significant effect on purchase amount, indicating customer preferences in these areas do not notably impact overall spending.
4 . Although small-sized items demonstrate the highest average purchase amount, medium-sized items outsell them in quantity.
5 . While blouse and jewelry witness high quantities sold, the average purchase amount is notably higher for hats and jackets.
6 . The sentiment analysis indicates that footwear products receive the highest level of positive sentiment among customers. This suggests that footwear items are well-received and 
    positively perceived by customers, potentially indicating a strong preference or satisfaction with this category of products.
