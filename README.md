### Information about datasetüìù

- This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to gain insights into customer preferences, seasonal trends, and purchasing behavior.
- The dataset provides comprehensive details about sales transactions, including information on customers' demographics, purchase amounts, payment methods, and frequency of purchases.

### Methodology
The analysis will involve **descriptive statistics**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and data visualization techniques. I use Python programming language along with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### Expected outcomes
Through this project, we aim to uncover actionable insights that can help retailers optimize their sales strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business performance.

## conclusionsüìå

1 . Among the purchasing customers, approximately 68% are male, with females comprising the remaining 32%. On average, females spend slightly more at 5019.2 compared to males, who spend an average of 4959.8.

2 . Customers tend to purchase the most during Spring and Fall.

3 . Payment method and shipping type show no significant effect on purchase amount, indicating customer preferences in these areas do not notably impact overall spending.

4 . Although small-sized items demonstrate the highest average purchase amount, medium-sized items outsell them in quantity.

5 . While blouse and jewelry witness high quantities sold, the average purchase amount is notably higher for hats and jackets.

6 . Sentiment analysis shows that footwear products receive the highest positive sentiment, indicating strong customer preference and satisfaction in this category.
